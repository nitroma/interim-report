\subsection{Sample AHP and TOPSIS calculation for product selection}

1. Pair-wise comparison of criteria: the scale developed by Saaty was adopted to assess the relative importance of one criteria to another. The fundamental scale is as follows: 1 for equal importance, 3 for moderate importance of one criteria over the other, 5 for essential or strong importance, 7 for very strong importance and 9 for extreme importance. Even numbers can be used as intermediate values. The results for product location are shown in Table

2. Determination of normalised weights:

3. Validation of consistency:

4. AHP score calculation:

5. Weighted Normalised Matrix for TOPSIS:

6. Euclidean distance from ideal best and ideal worst calculation:

7. Evaluation of Performance Score and ranking:
