\section{Unit Sizing Methodology}
\label{app:sizing}
\subsection{Reactor Sizing}
%Based on X paper, (include why reactors are PFR) (reference Levenspiel)
According to Froment/Bischoff, all 4 reactors chosen (packed-bed microreactor, trickle bed reactor, xxx, xxx) can be assumed to have the same [froment bischoff][tricklebed], which can be defined in the equation below:

The packed-bed microreactor and trickle bed reactor are assumed to have the same design equation as a plug flow reactor, as shown below:

\begin{equation}
    V_R = \int_{F_{A0}}^{F_{A}} \frac{dF_A}{-r_A} = \int_{F_{A0}}^{F_{A}} \frac{dF_A}{-kC_A}
    \label{reactor_sizing}
\end{equation}

Packed bed reactors and microreactors are commonly assumed to model plug flow behaviour 

\paragraph{}{Key assumption}
 
\indent 1.  Using the rate equation in the design equation accounts for intrinsic kinetics but not for mass transfer limitations when sizing the reactor. The effects of mass transfer limitations on the rate might be significant for the hydrogenation of ONT to o-toluidine as the rate is dependent on the catalyst. Including the effectiveness factor in the rate equation will provide a more accurate representation of the volume, but these limitations are not considered at this stage.

2.  Catalysts are used in all of the reactors in the design. For more accurate sizing of the reactors, the deactivation of the catalyst should be reflected in the rate equation given by the deactivation function. The catalysts used in the reactors have a relatively long deactivation time, so the deactivation of the catalysts is considered to be negligible at this stage.
