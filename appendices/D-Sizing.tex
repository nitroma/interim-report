\section{Unit Sizing Methodology}
\label{app:sizing}
\subsection{Reactor Sizing}
%Based on X paper, (include why reactors are PFR) (reference Levenspiel)
According to Froment/Bischoff, all 4 reactors chosen (packed-bed microreactor, trickle bed reactor, xxx, xxx) can be assumed to have the same [froment bischoff][tricklebed], which can be defined in the equation below:

The packed-bed microreactor and trickle bed reactor are assumed to have the same design equation as a plug flow reactor, as shown below:

\begin{equation}
    V_R = \int_{F_{A0}}^{F_{A}} \frac{dF_A}{-r_A} = \int_{F_{A0}}^{F_{A}} \frac{dF_A}{-kC_A}
    \label{reactor_sizing}
\end{equation}

Packed bed reactors and microreactors are commonly assumed to model plug flow behaviour 

\paragraph{}{Key assumptions}
 
\indent 1.  Using the rate equation in the design equation accounts for intrinsic kinetics but not for mass transfer limitations when sizing the reactor. The effects of mass transfer limitations on the rate might be significant for the hydrogenation of ONT to o-toluidine as the rate is dependent on the catalyst. Including the effectiveness factor in the rate equation will provide a more accurate representation of the volume, but these limitations are not considered at this stage.

2.  Catalysts are used in all of the reactors in the design. For more accurate sizing of the reactors, the deactivation of the catalyst should be reflected in the rate equation given by the deactivation function. The catalysts used in the reactors have a relatively long deactivation time [], so the deactivation of the catalysts is considered to be negligible at this stage.

\noindent Summary of the key assumptions involved in sizing the separator units and their sources of reference are listed in Table \ref{tab:assumptions of sizing separator units}. The methodologies are detailed below.

\paragraph{Crystallisers}
The crystallisers in this design have been sized by scaling against a past example of falling-film melt crystalliser develped by Sulzer Brothers Ltd. According to Seader et al. 2011, \cite{seader_separation_2011} this equipment produces high-purity crystals at a capacity of 100,000 tons/yr; it consists of a pair of units 4 m in diameter and 12 m in height. By assuming in this design that the solid crystals are pure and no wetting occurs, we scaled the crystalliser by its solid production rate:

\begin{equation}
    V = \frac{S}{10,000~ton/yr} \times 2 \times (2~m)^2 \pi \times 12~m
    \label{crystalliser_sizing}
\end{equation}

where $V$ is the volume of the crystalliser and $S$ the solid production rate in ton/yr. 

\paragraph{Flash drums}
According to Seader et al. 2011, \cite{seader_separation_2011} the minimum volume of a vertical reflux/flash drum is to be determined on the basis of liquid residence time; the liquid residence time should be at least 5 min and half of the vessel is assumed to be filled with liquid:

\begin{equation}
    V = \frac{2 L M_L t}{\rho_{L}}
    \label{flash_sizing}
\end{equation}

where $V$ is the volume of the flash drum, $L$ the molar liquid flow rate leaving the vessel, $M_L$ the average molecular weight of the liquid, $t$ the minimum residence time, and $\rho_L$ the average molar density of the liquid.
