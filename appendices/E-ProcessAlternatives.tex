\subsection{Nitration reactor}

\subsubsection{Packed-bed reactor}
A conventional packed-bed reactor was considered for the nitration process. This reactor is easy to operate because the packed structure of the catalyst removes the need for catalyst filtration in the outlet stream . The compact catalyst packing also allows for high zeolite catalyst loading, thus speeding up the reaction []. A simple modelling of a packed-bed reactor usually assumes perfect mixing, however, in reality flow maldistribution and hot spot formation occurs []. This is dangerous for the nitration process as any hot spots will promote the thermal runaway process that increases the risk of explosion. Therefore, to enhance the inherent safety of Nitroma's plant, this option was not pursued further.

\subsubsection{Stirred slurry reactor}
Stirred slurry reactor 
However, in the presence of solid H-mordenite catalyst, the mechanical agitation will erode the catalyst in the liquid suspension. Further filtration process needs to be implemented to prevent the catalysts 
To increase the conversion, multiple stirred slurry reactors will be needed to achieve 

\subsection{Toluidine hydrogenation reactor}
\label{toluidine}
\subsubsection{Stirred Slurry reactor}
An alternative reactor for toluidine hydrogenation was the slurry reactor. Attrition of the solid Pd catalyst will occur in slurry reactors due to the violent agitation in the reactor, damaging the catalyst. As Pd catalyst is considered as a precious metal, catalyst regeneration will be very expensive thus lowering the EP of this plant. Moreover, based on the kinetics of the oxidation reaction , the rate constant is strongly dependent on the catalyst weight, further proving the importance of low catalyst attrition [].
The slurry reactor is more suitable for gas-phased hydrogenation with the usage of $H_2$ gas at lower pressures, which is not applicable the current liquid-phase hydrogenation operating at high pressures (13atm).Therefore, this option was eliminated. []
