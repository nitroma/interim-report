\subsubsection{Packed-bed reactor}
A conventional packed-bed reactor was considered for the nitration process. This reactor is easy to operate because the packed structure of the catalyst removes the need for catalyst filtration in the outlet stream . The compact catalyst packing also allows for high zeolite catalyst loading []. A simple modelling of a packed-bed reactor usually assumes perfect mixing, however, in reality flow maldistribution and hot spot formation occurs []. This is dangerous for the nitration process as any hot spots will promote the thermal runaway process that increases the risk of explosion. Therefore, to increase the inherent safety of Nitroma's plant, this option was not pursued further.

\subsection{Toluidine hydrogenation reactor}
\label{toluidine}
\subsubsection{Stirred Slurry reactor}
An alternative reactor for toluidine hydrogenation was the slurry reactor. Attrition of the solid Pd catalyst will occur in slurry reactors due to the violent agitation in the reactor, damaging the catalyst. As Pd catalyst is considered as a precious metal, catalyst regeneration will be very expensive thus lowering the EP of this plant. Moreover, xxxx has shown that the oxidation reaction is heavily dependent on the amount of catalyst, t

A slurry reactor was more applicable for a lower pressure reaction, as 

was not applicable for a high pressure operations like this due to the mechanical parts and difficult
, thus this option was eliminated. []
