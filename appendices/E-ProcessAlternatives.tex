\subsubsection{Packed-bed reactor}
A conventional packed-bed reactor was considered for the nitration process. It is easy to operate because the packed structure of the catalyst removes the need for catalyst filtration in the outlet stream. A simple modelling of a packed-bed reactor usually assumes perfect mixing, however, in reality flow maldistribution and hot spot formation occurs []. This is dangerous for the nitration process as any hot spots promote the thermal runaway process that increases the risk of explosion. Therefore, 

\subsection{Toluidine hydrogenation reactor}
\label{toluidine}
An alternative reactor for toluidine hydrogenation was the slurry reactor. Attrition of the solid Pd catalyst will occur in slurry reactors due to the violent agitation in the reactor, damaging the catalyst. A slurry reactor was more applicable for a reaction with medium pressure and
