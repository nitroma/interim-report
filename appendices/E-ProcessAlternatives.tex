\subsubsection{Packed-bed reactor}
A conventional packed-bed reactor was considered for the nitration process. It is easy to operate because the packed structure of the catalyst removes the need for catalyst filtration in the outlet stream. However, a key drawback is 

\subsection{Toluidine hydrogenation reactor}
\label{toluidine}
An alternative reactor for toluidine hydrogenation was the slurry reactor. Attrition of the solid Pd catalyst will occur in slurry reactors due to the violent agitation in the reactor, damaging the catalyst. A slurry reactor was more applicable for a reaction with medium pressure and
