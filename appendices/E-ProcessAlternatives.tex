\subsection{Nitration reactor}
\label{nitrationreactor}
\subsubsection{Packed-bed reactor}
A conventional packed-bed reactor was considered for the nitration process. 

\subsection{Toluidine hydrogenation reactor}
\label{toluidine}
An alternative reactor for toluidine hydrogenation was the slurry reactor. Attrition of Pd catalyst will occur in slurry reactors due to the violent agitation in the reactor, damaging the catalyst and increasing
