\subsection{Nitration reactor}
\label{nitrationreactor}
\subsubsection{Packed-bed reactor}
A conventional packed-bed reactor was considered for the nitration process. This reactor is easy to operate because the packed structure of the catalyst removes the need for catalyst filtration in the outlet stream . The compact catalyst packing also allows for high zeolite catalyst loading, thus speeding up the reaction []. A simple modelling of a packed-bed reactor usually assumes perfect mixing, however, in reality flow maldistribution and hot spot formation occurs []. This is dangerous for the nitration process as any hot spots will promote the thermal runaway process that increases the risk of explosion. Therefore, to enhance the inherent safety of Nitroma's plant, this option was not pursued further.

\subsubsection{Stirred slurry reactor}
Stirred slurry reactor has an automatic agitator that controls the inflow and outflow of the product. This provides a high degree of automation [], which is particularly useful when the reaction temperature has to be carefully controlled. However, in the presence of solid H-mordenite catalyst, the mechanical agitation will erode the catalyst in the liquid suspension []. The catalytic activity decreases over time and needs to be regenerated to achieve the same conversion as fresh catalyst. Further filtration process also needs to be carried out on the reactor effluent to retain the catalyst in the reactor. The drawbacks outweigh the benefits, so this reactor was not chosen.

\subsection{Toluidine hydrogenation reactor}
\label{toluidine}
\subsubsection{Stirred Slurry reactor}
An alternative reactor for toluidine hydrogenation was the slurry reactor. The slurry reactor provides a steady agitation of the reaction, increasing the selectivity [mass transfer hydrogenation paper]. Attrition of the solid Pd catalyst will occur in slurry reactors due to the violent agitation in the reactor, damaging the catalyst. As Pd catalyst is considered as a precious metal, catalyst regeneration will be very expensive thus lowering the EP of this plant. Moreover, based on the kinetics of the oxidation reaction from Equation [label equation here], the rate constant is strongly dependent on the Pd catalyst weight, further proving the importance of low catalyst attrition [].
The slurry reactor is more suitable for gas-phased hydrogenation with the usage of $H_2$ gas at lower pressures, which is not applicable the current liquid-phase hydrogenation operating at high pressures (13atm). Therefore, the stirred slurry reactor option is eliminated. [trickle bed textbook]

\subsection{Reactor Sizing}
The design equation for all 4 reactors were assumed to be same as the design equation of a plug flow reactor, which can be defined in the equation below:

\begin{equation}
    V_R = F_{A0}
