\subsection{Price of chemicals}

The findings from an early study of market prices for the materials used in Nitroma's chemical plant is found in \cref{tab:material-prices}. These values were in the calculation of economic potential.

\subsection{Capital cost estimation}

Bridgewater's method outlined in Principles, Practices and Economics of Plant Design is used to estimate the capital cost of the chemical plant (XX).
\begin{equation}
    C=280000 \times N \times \left(\frac{Q}{s}\right)^{0.3}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $C$ is capital cost in \$, $Q$ is  plant capacity in t yr, $s$ is reactor conversion and $N$ is number of functional units (equipment and ancillaries needed for a significant process step such as reaction or separation).\\
The calculation was first carried out for the BA scenario.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split} 
C=& 280000 \times 15 \times \left(\frac{837.32}{0.27}\right)^{0.3}  \\
 & =\$46.9m 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
    
The calculation was then carried out for the BH scenario.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split} 
C=280000 \times 17 \times \left(\frac{1208.69}{0.94}\right)^{0.3}  \\
 & =\$40.8m 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The larger value of \$46.9m was taken as the final capital estimate for Nitroma's chemical plant as it reflects the highest estimated capital cost from Nitroma's two operational procedures.
