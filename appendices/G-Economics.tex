\subsubsection{Capital cost estimation}

The method outlined by Bridgewater in __ is used to estimate the capital cost of the chemical plant. 

\begin{equation}
    C=280,000 \times N \times (Q/s)^0.3
\end{equation}

where C = Capital cost in \$
s = Reactor conversion
N = Number of functional units (equipment and ancillaries needed for a significant process step such as reaction or separation)
