\section{Economic analysis}
\label{app:economics}
\subsection{Price of chemicals}

The findings from an early study of market prices for the materials used in Nitroma's chemical plant is found in \cref{tab:material-prices}. These values were in the calculation of economic potential.

\begin{table}[]
\begin{tabular}{lll}
    \hline
    Material    & Price (\$/kg) & Reference \\ \hline
    Toluene     & 0.62          & XX        \\
    Nitric acid & 0.31          & XX        \\
    Hydrogen    & 0             & XX        \\
    Propanol    & 1.15          & XX        \\
    Formic acid & 0.36          & XX        \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Economic potential: Level 1}

\subsection{Capital cost estimation}

Bridgewater's method outlined in Principles, Practices and Economics of Plant Design is used to estimate the capital cost of the chemical plant (XX).
\begin{equation}
    C=280000 \times N \times (\frac{Q}{s})^0.3
\end{equation}

where $C$ is capital cost in \$, $Q$ is  plant capacity in t yr, $s$ is reactor conversion and $N$ is number of functional units (equipment and ancillaries needed for a significant process step such as reaction or separation).\\
The calculation was first carried out for the BA scenario.
\begin{equation}
    C=280000 \times 15 \times (\frac{837.32}{0.27})^0.3
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    C=\$46.9m
\end{equation}
    
The calculation was then carried out for the BH scenario.
\begin{equation}
    C=280000 \times 17 \times (\frac{1208.69}{0.94} )^0.3
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    C=\$40.8m
\end{equation}

The larger value of \$46.9m was taken as the final capital estimate for Nitroma's chemical plant as it reflects the highest estimated capital cost from Nitroma's two operational procedures.
