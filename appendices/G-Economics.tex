\section{Economic analysis}
\label{app:economics}
\subsection{Price of chemicals}

Early findings from a study of market prices of the chemicals used in Nitroma's plant are found in \cref{tab:material-prices}. These values were used in the calculation of economic potential.

\begin{table}[h]

\caption{Price of chemicals in China}
\label{tab:material-prices}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    Material    & Price (\$/kg) & Reference \\ \midrule
    Toluene     & 0.62          & XX        \\
    Nitric acid & 0.31          & XX        \\
    Hydrogen    & 0.03         & XX        \\
    Propanol    & 1.15          & XX        \\
    Formic acid & 0.36          & XX        \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Economic potential: Level 1}
The economic potential of the plant was found using the following basic equations:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Economic potential} = \text{Revenue from products} - \text{Cost of raw materials}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{Revenue from products} = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{3} \text{Mass flow rate of product X} \cdot \text{Price of product X}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{Cost of raw materials} = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{5} \text{Mass flow rate of feed X} \cdot \text{Price of feed X}
\end{equation}
\\
From the Aspen simulation of Nitroma'a chemical plant, the following data regarding the feed and product streams was acquired:

\caption{Feed and product flow rates}
\label{tab:costing-flows}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    Stream type    & Material    & Mass flow rate (kg yr^{-1}) \\\midrule
%    & Stream type    & Material    & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Mass flow rate (\$/kg)}    \\\midrule
%    & \splitcell{-} & \splitcell{-} & {\splitcell{ABH scenario} & \splitcell{ABA scenario}}\\\midrule
    Feed 1     & Toluene     & 1,256,220.56                    \\
    Feed 2     & Nitric acid & 1,186,103.30                    \\
    Feed 3     & Hydrogen    & 507,628.78                      \\
    Feed 4     & Propanol    & 3,488,746.39                    \\
    Feed 5     & Formic acid & 29,286.60                       \\ 
    Product 1  & 4-ABH       & 78,070.00                       \\
    Product 2  & 4-ABA       & 406,032.01                      \\
    Product 3  & o-TOL       & 724,551.26                      \\\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Subsisting values from \cref{tab:material-prices} and \cref{tab:costing-flows} into Equations G.1, G.2 and G.3 yields and economic potential of \$12.0m per year for the ABH scenario and \$5.2m per year for the ABA scenario.

\subsection{Capital cost estimation}

Bridgewater's method outlined in Principles, Practices and Economics of Plant Design is used to estimate the capital cost of the chemical plant (XX). This uses the following equation:
\begin{equation}
    C= \num{280000} \times N \times \left(\frac{Q}{s}\right)^{0.3}
\end{equation}
where $C$ is capital cost in \$, $Q$ is  plant capacity in t yr, $s$ is reactor conversion and $N$ is number of functional units (equipment and ancillaries needed for a significant process step such as reaction or separation).

The calculation was first carried out for the ABA scenario.
\begin{align*}
C &= \num{280000} \times 15 \times \left(\frac{837.32}{0.27}\right)^{0.3}  \\
  &= \$46.9m 
\end{align*}

The calculation was then carried out for the ABH scenario.
\begin{align*}
C &= 280000 \times 17 \times \left(\frac{1208.69}{0.94}\right)^{0.3}  \\
  &=\$40.8m 
\end{align*}
The larger value of \$46.9m was taken as the final capital estimate for Nitroma's chemical plant as it reflects the highest estimated capital cost from Nitroma's two operational procedures.
