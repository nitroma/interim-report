\subsection{Capital cost estimation}

The method outlined by Bridgewater in XXXX is used to estimate the capital cost of the chemical plant.
\begin{equation}
    C=280000 \times N \times (\frac{Q}{s})^(0.3)
\end{equation}

The calculation was first carried out for the BA scenario.
\begin{equation}
    C=280000 \times 24 \times (\frac{837.32}{0.27})^0.3
\end{equation}
    
The calculation was then carried out for the BH scenario.
\begin{equation}
    C=280000 \times 24 \times (\frac{1208.69}{0.94} )^0.3
\end{equation}

where $C$ is Capital cost in \$, $Q$ is the plant capacity in tonnes per year
s is the reactor conversion
N = Number of functional units (equipment and ancillaries needed for a significant process step such as reaction or separation)
