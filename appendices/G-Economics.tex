\subsubsection{Capital cost estimation}

The method outlined by Bridgewater in is used to estimate the capital cost of the chemical plant.
\begin{equation}
    BA Scenario
    C=280000 \times N \times (Q/s)^0.3
\end{equation}

The calculation was first carried out for the BA scenario.
\begin{equation}
    C=280000 \times 24 \times (837.32/0.27)^0.3
\end{equation}
    
The calculation was then carried out for the BH scenario.
\begin{equation}
    C=280000 \times 24 \times (1208.69/0.27)^0.3
\end{equation}

where C = Capital cost in \$
Q = Plant capacity in tonnes per year
s = Reactor conversion
N = Number of functional units (equipment and ancillaries needed for a significant process step such as reaction or separation)
