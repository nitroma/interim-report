\subsection{Laws and Regulations }

\subsubsection{British Safety and Environmental Laws and Regulations}
\paragraph{1. Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations (COMAH) 2015} 

The COMAH Regulations focus on preventing major accidents occurring that involve the presence of dangerous substances and the mitigation of their impact should the accident occur. Incorporating most rules and requirements outlined by the Seveso III Directive, the primary goal of the COMAH Regulations is to protect the people, local communities, and the environment that these chemicals would adversely affect if an accident occurred \cite{noauthor_control_nodate}. 

\paragraph{2. The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) }

COSHH is a law which requires the implementation controls to prevent or minimise the exposure of substances and materials that are hazardous to health to labour workforce or any person who has access to the plant. Compliance to this regulation includes the identification of health hazards presented, conducting a risk assessment, integration and maintenance of controls and ensuring emergency plans and procedures are in place \cite{noauthor_what_nodate}.

\paragraph{3. The Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations (DSEAR) 2002}

The DSEAR are in place to ensure the safety of individuals from a fire, explosion and substances that are corrosive to metals by requesting that companies which handle substances which could ignite or explode, to put in controls to minimise the risk. The dangerous substances that must be controlled under this regulation include flammable gases, solvents, pressurised gases and substances corrosive to metal \cite{noauthor_dangerous_nodate}. 

\paragraph{4. The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974}
The aim of this Act is to protect the workforce, with the employer required to maintain a safe working environment. This includes the provision of health and safety policies, comprehensive training in essential procedures and controls to prevent emissions of toxic or harmful substances \cite{noauthor_health_nodate}.

\paragraph{5. Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) }
To ensure the safety of people and the environment, the REACH Regulation requires companies to perform risk identification of chemical substances that are being manufactured and provide a management strategy to ensure the safe use of the product, which should be shared with subsequent channels of the supply chain \cite{noauthor_uk_nodate}.

\paragraph{6. The Industrial Emissions Directive}

The directive’s primary concern is the protection of people and the environment by preventing or minimising the emissions released via industrial practises. This is achieved by application of the best available technique (BAT) to treat each type of waste substance appropriate \cite{noauthor_industrial_nodate}. 

\subsubsection{Chinese Safety and Environmental Laws and Regulations}

\paragraph{1. Decree 591: Regulations on the Control over Safety of Hazardous Chemicals}
Similar to the REACH regulation, Decree 591 is focused on the regulation of hazardous chemical substances. Industries are required to outline the hazards of each substances and detail methods for their safe use and storage to prevent any incidents and accidents from occurring. This information must be communicated to those further along the supply chain \cite{team_decree_nodate}. 

\paragraph{2. Hazardous Chemicals Control Ordinance
}
This focuses on managing the manufacture, transport and use of non-pesticide hazardous chemical substances that have detrimental effects on human health and on the environment. Industries are required to obtain specific permits for imports, exports and production of hazardous chemicals \cite{noauthor_hazardous_nodate}. 


\paragraph{3. Law on the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution}
The primary goal of this law is to protect the environment by mitigating and control atmospheric emissions of harmful gaseous substances. This includes greenhouse gases, volatile organic compounds and nitrogenous compounds. The law promotes the use of new technology and appropriate treatment methods to achieve a cleaner atmosphere \cite{vizzuality_law_nodate}. 

\paragraph{4. Production Safety Law of the People's Republic of China}
The aim of the Safety Law is to protect workers from any accidents that may cause serious health concerns or fatality. There must be proof of safe science and technology, with the regular examinations made to ensure there are safe practises in place when using hazardous substances \cite{noauthor_production_nodate}.  

\paragraph{5. Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law of the People's Republic of China  }
This law was devised for the prevention and control of water pollution in rivers, lakes and reservoirs and other ground water sources, to protect both the environment from ecological damage and humans who may ingest the water. Industries must carry out appropriate treatment of waste and report an incidents of water pollution \cite{noauthor_water_nodate}.

\subsection{Fire and Explosion Index}

\subsubsection{Assumptions Made }

When calculating the Fire and Explosion Index, several assumptions were made. This includes the assumption that the process plant will have:
\begin{itemize}
\item good access to the process unit
\item an effective drainage system and a good spillage control system
\item no leakage from storage units 
\item process storage tanks that will only be in flammable range due to instrument or equipment failure
\item a corrosion rate over 0.5 mil/yr
\end{itemize}

 
These assumptions present the ideal scenario for each of the reactor units, allowing appropriate penalties to be awarded. Using these assumptions, an estimation the Fire and Explosion Index was made based on accurate details on the temperature, pressure and the hazardous properties of materials present.
