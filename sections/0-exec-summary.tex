\section*{Executive Summary}
\label{sec:exec-summary}

Substituted aromatic amines are essential intermediates involved in the synthesis of many pharmaceutical compounds, agrochemicals, and dyes  \cite{vogt_amines_2000}. The amino group, which cannot be directly introduced via electrophilic aromatic substitution, is instead added via the nitration and subsequent reduction.
Following multiple deadly industrial accidents in chemical plants performing batch nitration, Chinese authorities are taking actions to strengthen the control and management of nitration manufacturing \cite{el_diario_china_2019}.
In this context, Nitroma seizes the opportunity of developing a multi-purpose and inherently safer continuous liquid-phase nitration process for the production of substituted aromatic  amines.
