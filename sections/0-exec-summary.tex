\section*{Executive Summary}
\label{sec:exec-summary}

Substituted aromatic amines are essential intermediates involved in the synthesis of many pharmaceutical compounds, agrochemicals, and dyes \cite{vogt_amines_2000}. The amino group, which cannot be directly introduced via electrophilic aromatic substitution, is instead added via nitration and subsequent reduction. Following multiple deadly industrial accidents in chemical plants performing batch nitration, Chinese authorities are taking actions to strengthen the control and management of nitration manufacturing \cite{el_diario_china_2019}.

In this context, Nitroma seizes the opportunity of developing a multi-purpose and inherently safer continuous liquid-phase nitration process to produce o-toluidine, 4-aminobenzaldehyde and 4-aminobenzoic acid. This report details the preliminary design for Nitromaâ€™s demonstration plant, to be located in the Nanjing Chemical Industry Park (China). Synthesis pathways for nitration, oxidation and hydrogenation reactions were selected and modelled in innovative packed-bed microreactors or trickle-bed reactors. Novel downstream processing units, including continuous falling-film melt crystallisers, enable Nitroma to reach the target product purity. Finally, a techno-economic feasibility study was conducted, taking into account health, safety and environmental considerations.
