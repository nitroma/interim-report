\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Substituted aromatic amines are essential intermediates involved in the synthesis of many pharmaceutical compounds, agrochemicals, and dyes \cite{vogt_amines_2000}. The easy replacement of the amino group by other functional groups makes them very attractive versatile intermediates. The amino group, which cannot be directly introduced via electrophilic aromatic substitution, is instead added via the nitration of the aromatic ring, followed by reduction.

Following multiple deadly industrial accidents in chemical plants performing batch nitration, especially the 2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion, Chinese authorities are taking actions to strengthen the control and management of nitration manufacturing. Inspections and in-depth risk assessments are expected to be conducted to ensure compliance of the plants with the regulations on dangerous chemicals \cite{noauthor_china_2019}. 

In this context, Nitroma seizes the opportunity of developing a multi-purpose and continuous liquid phase nitration process for the conversion of substituted aromatics to their respective nitrates and subsequently to their amines.
