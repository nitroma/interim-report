\subsection{Decision analysis}
%explain TOPSIS and AHP
To make systematic and informed decisions for key aspects of the project, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods were employed. Firstly, pairwise comparison of the criteria was performed with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to produce criteria weightings which were fed into the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) analysis. Processing of all relevant information through AHP and TOPSIS analysis yielded quantitative rankings for process alternatives, which were initially short-listed with qualitative arguments. Greater importance was given to safety and environmental concerns, technical performance and economic potential.


\subsection{Product selection}
To deliver a multi-purpose plant, Nitroma selected toluene as feedstock due to the industrial importance of its nitration products and their amino derivatives. All three isomeric nitrotoluenes can indeed easily be oxidised and reduced to substituted aromatic amides of significant importance for the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and textile industries \cite{dugal_nitrobenzene_2005}. Six chemicals were initially selected due to their applications in drugs, fertilisers or dyes \cite{bowers_toluidines_2000,bruhne_benzaldehyde_2011,maki_benzoic_2000}. To determine the three most advantageous products to produce, AHP/TOPSIS analysis was conducted, giving significant importance to the safety of the compounds and their economic potential. Safety was assessed using the NFPA Hazard Classification for health, flammability and instability, where the smallest value is preferable. The economic potential of each chemical was determined using the average price, the average market share of producers which is an indicator of the market share Nitroma can plan to capture, the global demand and the expected market growth (CAGR). \Cref{tab:product} summarises the results and the complete methodology can be found in \Cref{app:matrix}.

\subsection{Nitration method}
\subsubsection{Choice of nitrating agent}
Nitric acid, introduced as an aqueous solution, has been selected as the source of nitrogen for the nitration of toluene for its safe and environmentally friendly nature relative to alternatives such as acetone cyanohydrin and dinitrogen tetroxide, which are highly toxic \cite{miller_kinetics_1964,dagade_nitration_2002, sreedhar_scientific_2013}. 



\begin{comment}
Nitric acid has been selected as the source of nitrogen for the nitration of toluene for its safe and environmentally friendly nature relative to other possible nitrating agents, high availability, and its various favourable properties \cite{miller_kinetics_1964, sreedhar_scientific_2013}. Although nitric acid is a highly acidic and volatile compound, compared to alternatives such as acetone cyanohydrin and dinitrogen tetroxide which are highly toxic, nitric acid is more appropriate for industrial-scale nitration of toluene \cite{dagade_nitration_2002, sreedhar_scientific_2013}. Nitric acid, introduced as an aqueous solution, is the most commonly used and well-studied nitrating agent for this process in industry. \cite{bowers_toluidines_2000} A big advantage of aqueous nitric acid is that it can act as a self-catalyst by self-donating protons. \cite{miller_kinetics_1964} A common alternative to nitric acid is acetyl nitrate which is formed by the reaction of nitric acid with acetic anhydride. \cite{vassena_selective_1999} This reaction yields formic acid as by-product, resulting in a lower atom economy; it also causes unnecessary difficulties in separations downstream by introducing three extra components: acetyl nitrate, acetic anhydride, and formic acid. The same argument can be employed for other alkyl nitrates such as butyl nitrate. To this end, nitric acid is deemed as the most suitable choice among all candidates.

\subsubsection{Choice of catalyst}
Nitration in industry is mainly carried out by a mixed-acid process []. In addition to favouring less economically desirable \textit{ortho} isomers, product separation from the acid and acid regeneration are expensive and energy intensive \cite{sreedhar_scientific_2013}. These drawbacks can be overcome by using solid acid catalysts which offer an environmentally friendly and economic alternative to sulfuric acid \cite{vassena_selective_1999}. Based on those arguments, Nitroma will develop a safer and low environmental impact process employing zeolite catalysts for toluene nitration. More specifically, the relative benefits and disadvantages of 3 different zeolites were evaluated with the AHP and TOPSIS decision analysis methods. The economic potential, performance and safety of zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-Y and H-Mordenite were assessed and compared to the case with no catalyst \cite{jeeru_kinetics_2018}. H-Mordenite was found optimum for the catalytic nitration of toluene by both AHP and TOPSIS analysis (see \Cref{tab:nitration} in \Cref{app:matrix}). The kinetic model for the reaction was then developed and is presented in \Cref{app:kinetics}.

Nitration in industry is mainly carried out by a mixed-acid process, whereby sulfuric acid donates a proton to nitric acid, yielding a nitronium ion which will then react with toluene []. In addition to favouring less economically desirable \textit{ortho} isomers, product separation from the acid and acid regeneration are expensive and energy intensive \cite{sreedhar_scientific_2013}. These drawbacks can be overcome by using solid acid catalysts which offer an environmentally friendly and economic alternative to sulfuric acid \cite{vassena_selective_1999}. Based on those arguments, Nitroma will develop a safer and low environmental impact process employing zeolite catalysts for toluene nitration.

The economic potential, performance and safety of zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-Y and H-Mordenite were assessed and compared to the case with no catalyst \cite{jeeru_kinetics_2018}. The economic potential was measured with the cost of the catalyst and the percentage of undesirable by-product formed. Conversion and the NFPA score are the KPIs for performance and safety respectively. H-Mordenite was found optimum for the catalytic nitration of toluene by both AHP and TOPSIS analysis (see \Cref{app:matrix}). The kinetic model for the reaction was then developed and is presented in \Cref{app:kinetics}.

\subsection{Nitrotoluene Oxidation and hydrogenation pathways}
\subsubsection{\ortho-toluidine production}
The \textit{ortho} isomer of nitrotoluene is reduced to o-toluidine using  2\% w/w palladium-on-carbon (Pd/C) catalyst in the liquid-phase \cite{rajadhyaksha_solvent_1986}. This reaction is carried out in a solvent to dissolve solid reactants and products, absorb the heat of exothermic reaction and protect the catalyst surface from impurities []. Five different solvents were compared using AHP/TOPSIS analysis to determine the optimum solvent based on economic potential, performance, safety and environmental considerations. The performance of a solvent was measured through the activation energy of the reaction, the reaction rate at 333K and the solubility of \ch{H2} in the solvent \cite{rajadhyaksha_solvent_1986}. Nitroma values the importance of using green solvents in its process and evaluated the sustainability of the different solvents using scores developed by GSK to assess the environmental impacts of the chemicals \cite{henderson_expanding_2011}. The GSK scored for health and flammability were also used for safety. If a solvent could be sourced from renewable feed stocks, it was viewed positively \cite{byrne_tools_2016}. Both TOPSIS and AHP analysis found that propanol was the most suitable green solvent for the reduction of 2-nitrotoluene (see \Cref{tab:solvent} in \Cref{app:matrix}). 

\begin{comment}
The \textit{ortho} isomer of nitrotoluene (53\%) is reduced to o-toluidine using  2\% w/w palladium-on-carbon (Pd/C) catalyst in the liquid-phase \cite{rajadhyaksha_solvent_1986}. This reaction is carried out in a solvent to dissolve solid reactants and products, absorb the heat of exothermic reaction and protect the catalyst surface from impurities. The chosen solvent can significantly affect the rate and selectivity of the hydrogenation []. Five different solvents, including methanol, propanol, butanol, cyclohexanol and hexane, were compared using AHP/TOPSIS analysis to determine the optimum solvent based on economic potential, performance, safety and environmental considerations. The performance of a solvent was measures through the activation energy of the reaction, the reaction rate at 333K and the solubility of \ch{H2} in the solvent \cite{rajadhyaksha_solvent_1986}. The financial KPI is solvent cost. Nitroma values this importance of using green solvents in its process and evaluated the sustainability of the different solvents using scores developed by GSK to assess the environmental impacts to produce the solvent, waste treatment and the fate and effects of the chemicals on the environment \cite{henderson_expanding_2011}. The GSK scores for health and flammability were also used. If a solvent could be sourced from renewable feed stocks, it was viewed positively \cite{byrne_tools_2016}. Both TOPSIS and AHP found that propanol was the most suitable green solvent for the reduction of 2-nitrotoluene. The table of scores is located in \Cref{app:matrix}.

%In all the above runs, the rates of reaction remained constant in each experiment for a conversion of more than 90\%, indicating zero-order dependence on the concentration of the nitro compound. The results indicate a 0.3 order dependence on hydrogen pressure or first order for pressure >280 kPa

\subsubsection{4-nitrotoluene oxidation}
4-nitrotoluene is oxidised, in this sequence, to nitro-substituted benzyl alchohol, benzaldehyde and benzoic acid, as shown in Figure xx of \Cref{app:kinetics} []. In order to produce either 4-nitrobenzaldehyde or 4-nitrobenzoic acid with the same equipment, Nitroma aims to develop a multipurpose process controlled to favour either partial or complete oxidation. 

The catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of toluene is known to produce substantial quantities of benzoic acid even when operated for the specified purpose of  benzaldehyde manufacturing \cite{bruhne_benzaldehyde_2011}. For this reason, vapour-phase oxidation with oxygen was selected, since it is also a potential route for nitrobenzoic acid production \cite{maki_benzoic_2000}. 

The oxidizer can be provided as pure molecular oxygen or air. Motivated by safety consideration, air provides nitrogen as unreactive gas, thus enabling the dilution of nitrotoluene vapour \cite{bruhne_benzaldehyde_2011}. 

Many solid catalysts have been investigated and the conversion of 4-nitrotoluene to 4-nitrobenzaldehyde was found to be only possible when carried out with cobalt salts catalyst []. 

Oxides of the elements of Groups V and VI of the periodic table are frequently used as catalysts, sometimes with other oxides. These oxide catalysts contain molybdenum and at least one additional element from among iron, nickel, cobalt, antimony, bismuth, vanadium, phosphorus, samarium, tantalum, tin, and chromium (25). Some have palladium and phosphoric acid on activated carbon (26). Others are mixed oxides of silver and transition metals, such as cobalt nickel, vanadium, platinum, or palladium (27), and one is a mixture of silver vanadate and iron vanadate (28).



\subsubsection{4-aminobenzoic acid and 4-aminobenzaldehyde synthesis}
The amino- substituted products are formed via the direct reduction of their nitro- counterparts.
Whilst a broad variety of novel processes, catalysts and conditions have been proposed in the literature, the industrial production of aromatic amines focuses almost exclusively on the use of metal catalysts: commonly Pd/C or Pt/C, with some examples using Ni, Co, or Cu \cite{wiley-vch_verlag_gmbh__co_kgaa_amines_2000,cartolano_amines_2004}.
Examples exist of both liquid- and vapour-phase processes, with the latter now preferred for safety reasons as the hydrogenation is highly exothermic.
A broad variety of solvents may be used; short-chain alcohols are a typical example.
In the interest of modularity, conditions were sought under which both the carboxylic acid- and aldehyde-substituted nitration products could be simultaneously reduced.
Consequently, a process employing a \SI{5}{\percent\of{w/w}} Pt/C catalyst in methanol, with ammonium formate as the reducing agent was selected.
This process gives yields of \SIlist{86;80}{\percent} for the aminobenzoic acid and aminobenzaldehyde respectively [].
