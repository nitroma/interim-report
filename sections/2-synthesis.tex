\subsection{Decision analysis}
%explain TOPSIS and AHP
To make systematic and informed decisions for key aspects of the project, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods were employed. Firstly, pairwise comparison of the criteria was performed with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to produce criteria weightings which were fed into the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) analysis. Processing of all relevant information though AHP and TOPSIS analysis yielded quantitative rankings for process alternatives, which were initially streamlined with qualitative arguments.

%The key choices involved: an appropriate reactor technology, pre-treatment for the feed stream, the solid product separation technique, and the gas product separation route. For each section of the process, EP, safety and environmental impact, complexity and controllability, and specific criteria to each section were considered.
%Safety and environmental factors have been considered in detail for each process synthesis decision. This involves using a modified safety & environmental index as well as aligning the process with the 12 Principles of Green Engineering[23] and HydroPyroâ€™s aims to minimise CO2 emissions. The modified index, shown in Table N, combines Dows Fire & Explosion Index in which NFPA ratings for each substance, summarised in Table O, and important safety factors were considered, with an environmental index which considered gaseous and aqueous emissions along with the best available treatment required.

\subsection{Nitration method}
\subsubsection{Choice of nitrating agent}

Nitric acid has been selected as the source of nitrogen for the nitration of toluene because of its various advantages.

Industrially, nitric acid is the most commonly used nitrating agent for this process. (cite Ullmann's toluidine) It is thus also the most well-studied in the literature. Usually, it is introduced into the process as an aqueous solution. As some studies have suggested, one of the distinct advantages of nitric acid is that due to its strong acidity, it can act as a self-catalyst by self-donation of proton during the nitration of toluene, (cite that nice paper), though a strong acidic catalyst such as sulfuric acid or zeolite is nonetheless recommended in a typical process.

A common alternative to nitric acid for toluene nitration is acetyul nitrate. Its introduction into the process is usually done as a mixture of nitric acid and acetic anhydride, which forms acetyl nitrate upon reaction and methanoic acid as by-product. Compared to employing just nitric acid as the nitrating agent, we consider the use of acetyl nitrate as unnecessary as it is not atom economic and it will cause extra difficulties in separations downstream by introducing more components into the process. The same argument can be employed for other alkyl nitrates such as butyl nitrate. 

Although nitric acid is not generally considered a safe and environmentally friendly chemical due to its high acidity and volatility, an important advantage of it compared to many other nitrating agents is that it is much safer and less environmentally damaging. Alternatives like acetone cyanohydrin and dinitrogen tetroxide are highly toxic and not ideal for industrial-scale nitration of toluene. Nitric acid is relatively easy to treat and handle from both environmental and safety perspectives.
