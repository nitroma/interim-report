A common alternative to nitric acid is acetyl nitrate which is formed by the reaction of nitric acid with acetic anhydride \cite{vassena_selective_1999}. This reaction yields formic acid as by-product, resulting in a lower atom economy; it also causes unnecessary difficulties in separations downstream by introducing three extra components: acetyl nitrate, acetic anhydride, and formic acid. The same argument can be employed for other alkyl nitrates such as butyl nitrate. To this end, nitric acid is deemed as the most suitable choice among all candidates.
