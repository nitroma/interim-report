%selection criteria
%innovation
In line with Nitroma's goal of transitioning from batch to continuous process, microreactors were chosen for the nitration of toluene. (Alternative continuous reactors were cobns
The catalysts in the microreactors were

\subsection{o-toluidine production}
%trickle bed reactor
%Pd/c catalyst
For the o-toluidine hydrogenation, a cocurrent trickle bed reactor was selected
with both gas and liquid reactants flowing downwards. Trickle bed reactor was chosen 
due to the suitability for a 3 phase reaction
