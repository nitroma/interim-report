%reactor design
%selection criteria
%innovation
In line with Nitroma's goal of transitioning from batch to continuous process, packed-bed microreactors were chosen for the nitration of toluene. Due to their high surface area to volume ratio, microreactors are superior in heat transfer as compared to conventional batch or semi-batch reactors []. This was an important criteria when choosing nitration reactors as nitration is a highly exothermic process with the hazard of thermal runaway if the temperature is not controlled. Additionally, microreactors offer the benefit

There has been an increasing interest in deploying microreactors on large scale nitration processes, but most industrial nitration reactors are still limited to batch and semi-batch processes. Therefore, Nitroma is poised to gain the first mover advantage by designing a s

\subsection{o-toluidine production}
%trickle bed reactor
%Pd/c catalyst
For the o-toluidine hydrogenation, a cocurrent trickle bed reactor was selected
with both gas and liquid reactants flowing downwards. Trickle bed reactor was chosen due to the ease of operation at high pressure (13 atm) and the relative slow catalyst deactivation, which is imperative for an expensive catalyst usage of Pd. Moreover, the plug flow liquid flow in trickle bed reactor allows for a higher conversion than other reactors, matching  the 90\% conversion rate target of o-toluidine by Nitroma.
