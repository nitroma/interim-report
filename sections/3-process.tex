%innovation
In line with Nitroma's goal of transitioning from batch to continuous process, packed-bed microreactors were chosen for the nitration of toluene. Due to their high surface area to volume ratio, microreactors are superior in heat transfer []. This reduces the risk of thermal runaway that are common in highly exothermic nitration reactions. Additionally,   
There has been an increasing interest in deploying microreactors on large scale nitration processes, therefore Nitroma is poised to gain the first mover advantage by

%Pd/c catalyst
For the o-toluidine hydrogenation, a cocurrent trickle bed reactor was selected
with both gas and liquid reactants flowing downwards. Trickle bed reactor was chosen due to the ease of operation at high pressure (13 atm)
due to the suitability for a 3 phase reaction
