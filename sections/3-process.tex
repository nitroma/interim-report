\subsection{Nitration step}
%reactor design
%selection criteria
%innovation
In line with Nitroma's goal of transitioning from batch to continuous process, packed-bed microreactors were chosen for the nitration of toluene. Due to their high surface area to volume ratio, microreactors are superior in heat transfer as compared to conventional batch or semi-batch reactors \cite{halder_nitration_2007}. This was an important criteria when choosing nitration reactors as nitration is a highly exothermic process with the hazard of thermal runaway if the temperature is not controlled. Additionally, the high mass transfer rate within the microreactors prevent the formation of by-products \cite{halder_nitration_2007} which complicates the separation process downstream.
(Alternative continuous reactors that were considered are detailed in Appendix \ref{nitrationreactor}.)

There has been an increasing interest in deploying microreactors on large scale nitration processes, but most industrial nitration reactors are still limited to batch and semi-batch processes. Therefore, Nitroma is poised to gain the first mover advantage by scaling up safe, highly-efficient, and novel microreactors capable of handling hundreds of tons of throughput per year.

Toluene (95\% molar basis) and nitric acid (50\% molar basis) are fed to the isothermal packed-bed microreactor operating at 333K, 1 atm, and 90\% conversion. The reaction produces 3 isomers of nitrotoluene --- o-nitrotoluene (ONT), m-nitrotoluene (MNT) and p-nitrotoluene (PNT) --- at a selectivity ratio of 53:4:44 respectively. The reactor effluent consists of the 3 isomers along with nitric acid, water and unreacted toluene that are subsequently separated downstream.

\subsection{Nitrotoluene isomers separation}
The separation of the reactor effluent begins as it is fed to a decanter (S101) to separate the aqueous phase of nitric acid and water from the organic phase. The nitric acid is recycled back into the nitration reactor at a 94\% (mole) purity after being concentrated in a distillation column (S102) that boils off water.

Meanwhile, the organic phase is sent to a distillation column (S103) that recovers 99.8 mol\% of the toluene from the less volatile nitrotoluenes, and fed back to the nitration reactor. The nitrotoluenes are sent to another distillation column (S201) to separate 99.99 mol\% of the more volatile o-nitrotoluene from m and p-nitrotoluene. The large difference in the melting points of the p and m-nitrotoluene is exploited in the separation of the isomers in a continuous falling-film crystalliser (S202). 

The nitrotoluene isomer separation is a crucial step, as it determines the production rate of downstream products. Thus the separation techniques above were carefully selected using both a quantitative method (Jakskand analysis)[] and sound engineering judgement (Details in Appendix [ ]). Operating conditions of each separation unit can also be found in Appendix []. 

\subsection{Production of o-toluidine}
%trickle bed reactor

%add flowrate, temperature, pressure, what phases,  isothermal/adiabatically
The o-nitrotoluene is then hydrogenated to o-toluidine in a co-current trickle bed reactor with both gas and liquid reactants flowing downwards. Trickle bed reactor was chosen due to the ease of operation at high pressure (13 atm) and the relative slow catalyst deactivation, which is imperative for an expensive catalyst usage of Pd \cite{vemala_hydrodynamic_nodate}. Co-current flow is selected due to the reduced risk of flooding, thus allowing for large flow of products[]. Moreover, the liquid plug flow behaviour in trickle bed reactor allows for a higher conversion than other reactors, matching the 90\% conversion rate target of o-toluidine by Nitroma. 

o-toluidine is then purified to meet the purity requirement of 98mol\%. A flash drum (S501) is first used to remove excess hydrogen gas from the reactor effluent. A distillation column (S502) then removes the propanol and water from the less volatile organic compounds. Finally, a second distillation column (S503) removes 94.8mol\% of unreacted o-nitrotoluene, yielding a 99.4mol\% pure o-toluidine product.

\subsection{Production of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-nitrobenzoic acid}
The crystallised 4-nitrotoluene is dissolved in a methanol solvent, and then fed into a packed-bed reactor to be oxidised with air. [mention reaction conditions] The operating conditions of the reactor are optimised to either partial oxidation to produce 4-nitrobenzaldehyde or complete oxidation to product 4-nitrobenzoic acid, depending on which product is desired.  

The oxidation reactors are operated in parallel, with each of the reactors producing their respective main products (4-NBAH or 4-NBA). Future work will be done to redesign the oxidation reactors to be in series to reduce the loss of unreacted reactants.

The effluent from both reactors are sent to a flash drum (S301) that removes air and water vapour from the organics stream. The organic stream is then fed into a distillation column (S302), where 99.9mol\% of the unreacted p-nitrotoluene is separated from the less volatile nitroaromatics. 

Processing the effluent from the 4-nitrobenzoic acid reactor in column S302 will also result in 99mol\% of 4-nitrobenzaldehdye as well as water being removed with the p-nitrotoluene. These chemicals are separated in a second distillation column (S303), yielding a 93mol\% pure p-nitrotoluene stream which can be sold as a by-product and a 58.9mol\% pure 4-nitrobenzaldehyde stream. Future work will recycle the 4-nitrobenzaldehyde to the oxidation reactor to be converted to 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

The effluent from the 4-nitrobenzaldehyde reactor contains a 9.7mol\% of 4-nitrobenzoic acid, of which 99.9 mol\% is separated from the more volatile compounds in S302. The lighter p-nitrotoluene,  4-nitrobenzaldehyde and water are separated in column S303, yielding a 99.9mol\% pure 4-nitrobenzaldehyde stream and a waste stream containing p-nitrotoluene and water. Future work will recycle the unreacted p-nitrotoluene into the oxidation reactor.

\subsection{Hydrogenation to 4-aminobenzaldehyde and 4-aminobenzoic acid}

Finally, both 4-aminobenzaldehyde and 4-aminobenzoic acid is hydrogenated into two separate packed-bed reactors**, using formic acid as hydrogen donor. The selection of formic acid is i. The packed-bed reactor is selected due to the control and 

The amino products are separately purified. The effluent from the 4-aminobenzaldehyde reactor is sent to a flash (S601) to remove air and water vapour.  Then, two distillation columns are employed to remove unreacted 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and remaining water to yield a 99.9mol\% purified 4-aminobenzaldehyde. 97mol\% of the 4-aminobenzaldehyde produced in the reactor can be recovered at the end of the separation.

The effluent from the 4-aminobenzoic acid reactor is sent to a flash (S601) to remove air. The remaining liquid is then sent to a continuous falling-film crystalliser to obtain pure 4-aminobenzoic acid crystals. It was decided that due to the large amount of water present, a distillation column would require a high heat duty to separate the compounds. The crystalliser is able to yield a 96mol\% recovery of 4-aminobenzoic acid from the reactor.

\subsection{Major equipment sizing}


\subsection{Process alternatives}
During the design, several options were considered for different sections of the process. The main alternative for nitration is the process with mixed-acid instead of Nitroma's heterogeneous reaction process. The direct production of 4-aminobenzaldehyde from 4-nitrotoluene was also examined. Furthermore, multiple reactor types were envisioned for nitration, oxidation and hydrogenation. Details of those process alternatives can be found in \Cref{app:alternatives}.

The initial design process also considered alternative separation techniques such as absorption, adsorption, microfiltration and membrane separation. While these techniques are relatively novel compared to those employed in the current design, they were eventually discarded due to two main reasons: relatively lower recovery, and more costly installation and purchasing cost. Full details can be seen in Appendix [].
