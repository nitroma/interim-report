Table ~\ref{tab:market} lists the average market price, estimated market demand in China and the estimated CAGR based on market reports of the three synthetic intermediates to be manufactured at Nitroma. The demand was forecasted based on  CAGR of end-products from these intermediates. CAGR is used as a guide to predict the market growth for these products. The market demand for all these products in China are expected to be driven by increasing population and so increasing demand for pharmaceutical drugs and herbicides in agriculture.

\subsection{Feedstock Supply}
Toluene is used in construction, explosions and agrochemicals which drives the domestic demand for it in China []. The price of toluene is susceptible to fluctuating prices in crude oil which leads to fluctuating global supply and demand []. Domestic supply in China increased in 2019 due to plant expansions []. As a result, when demand for toluene declined during Covid-19 pandemic, China had surplus supply and the price fell dramatically. Major disruptions in the ports due to restrictions resulted in reduced supply []. However, with new capacity in China, domestic production of toluene is expected to increase and provide reliable supply with increasing operating rates []. Toluene will be sourced from potential suppliers in nearby provinces.
