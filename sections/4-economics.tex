\subsubsection{Feedstock Supply}
Toluene is used in construction, explosions and agrochemicals which drives the domestic demand for it in China []. The price of toluene is susceptible to fluctuating prices in crude oil which leads to fluctuating global supply and demand []. China had plant expansions in 2019 [] therefore domestic production of toluene is expected to increase and provide reliable supply[]. Toluene will be sourced from Sinopec Yangzi Petrochemical in Jiangsu, China[].
