\subsection{Health and Safety}

Inherent safety, hazard identification and risk analysis were fundamental elements in the design of the process plant. Each of the inherent safety principles (minimisation, substitution, moderation and simplification) were employed in the initial design stage of the process plant. The hazardous inventory has been reduced by utilising toluene as the initial feedstock material for all three of the products manufactured. The continuous nature of the process presents a safer option than the batch operation alternative, as it requires a smaller inventory of substances and reduces threat of thermal runaway due to hot-spot formation. Furthermore, a continuous process will allow adaptable automatic control, eliminating the need for manual interaction and handling and thus reduces risks associated with human error \cite{}. A key substitution was the choice of catalyst for the nitration, with the H-mordenite zeolite favoured over the more classic option, concentrated sulphuric acid which is highly corrosive and extremely reactive. Moderations were made in terms of plant layout, isolating the hazardous process units as much as possible, preventing sequential events should a fire or explosion with one process unit. Efforts were made to simplify the overall design of the plant; minimising the number of reaction and separation units present which lowered the complexity of the plant whilst enabling specified process targets to be met. 

The specific hazards of each chemical component have been considered, with the presence of the NFPA 704 values, the flash point value, the auto-ignition temperature, vapour pressure and the Globally Harmonized System (GHS)Hazards respectively (Appendix \ref{app:EHS}, Table \ref{tab:chemID}). All substances have a relatively low reactivity rating (of 0-1). There are two oxidisers presnt (nitric acid and oxygen) and the most flammable material identified was hydrogen gas.  Various precautions will be taken to control the associated hazards each of the substances hold, including control over their use and storage.  

Fires, explosions and the release of toxic substances are the typical consequences of the major process hazards which can occur in a chemical plant \cite{mannan_lees_2012}. For each of the main hazards identified in Nitroma's process plant that may result in the occurrence of these events, the risk was estimated in a qualitative approach using the severity-likelihood risk matrix, found in Appendix \ref{app:EHS}, Table \ref{tab:risk-matrix}. For a quantitative hazard assessment, Dow's Fire and Explosion Index was utilised to identify which specific process units are most liable to  a fire, blast or explosion occurring, sizing the amount of damage it would inflect should the incident occur (Appendix \red 

The hazard identification and risk analysis allow the implementation of appropriate actions and controls to mitigate potential process hazards. This includes integrating appropriate temperature and pressure monitors into reactors, the fitting of cooling jackets and firewalls, and the selection of material best suited for preventing the loss of containment in storage tanks.


\subsection{Environmental Impact}

The modular nature of the process plant indicates waste streams will be identified at various units across the plant. Following guidance from the 12 Principles of Green Engineering and the waste hierarchy system, efforts have been made to prevent waste where possible (as opposed to treating it). Whilst the traditional method of nitration involves the mixture of nitric and sulphuric acid as reagents, disposal of ‘spent’ sulphuric acids can be environmentally unfriendly and costly. Therefore, alternative method using recyclable zeolite catalyst will be utilised  \cite{smith_superior_1996}. The toluene for the nitration solvent will be re-used through a recovery system. Formic acid was chosen as a reducing agent for the hydrogenation reactions over ammonium formate to prevent the emission of  ammonia. Energy recovery is being considered from the waste stream of nitration by utilising the energy for heat exchange from the nitric acid and water mixture. 

However, despite efforts made, the presence of waste substances is inevitable. Where disposal is unavoidable, the waste will be treated to ensure compliance with environmental regulations regarding threshold limits. The national wastewater treatment works regulatory body states that the maximum threshold limits for the biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand are \SIlist{50;250}{\mg\of{\ch{O2}}\per\l} respectively, whilst the maximum concentration limit of total nitrogen is \SI{15}{\mg\of{\ch{N}}\per\l} \cite{noauthor_waste_nodate}.
