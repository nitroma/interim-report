\section{Conclusions and Outlook}
\label{sec:conclu}
Nitroma has designed a multi-purpose plant for the nitration of toluene and subsequent oxidation and hydrogenation of nitrotoluene isomers to valuable substituted amines.
Control of nitrotoluene oxidation enables production flexibility to meet market demands.
Importantly, Nitroma has developed a continuous liquid-phase nitration process, replacing hazardous sulfuric acid with zeolite catalyst.
Continuous processing in packed-bed microreactors diminishes the risk of hot-spot formation and thermal runaways, typical of traditional batch processes.
Nitroma plans to take advantage of the favourable economic and political situation in China to implement its innovative process, while ensuring complete compliance to the health, safety and environmental regulations in force.

Further work includes the design of the reactors in series, implementing recycle loops, and optimising the operating conditions of separation units. Mechanical designs of the reactor and separation units will also be  of the reactor, optimising the operating conditions of separation units, heat integration, design of waste treatment systems as well as the establishment of a robust control system for the process.
