\section{Conclusions and Outlook}
\label{sec:conclu}
Nitroma has designed a multi-purpose plant for the nitration of toluene and subsequent oxidation and hydrogenation of nitrotoluene isomers to valuable substituted amines. The control of nitrotoluene oxidation enables to switch production line and offers great production flexibility. Most importantly, Nitroma developed a continuous liquid-phase nitration process, replacing hazardous sulfuric acid with zeolite catalyst. Continuous operation of packed-bed microreactor diminishes the risk of hot-spot formation and thermal runaways, typical of traditional batch processes. Nitroma aims at taking advantage of the favourable economic and political situation in China to implement its innovative process, while ensuring complete compliance to the new health, safety and environmental regulations in place. Further work includes mechanical design of the reactor and separation units as well as the establishment of a robust control system for the process.
