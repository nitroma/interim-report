	abstract = {Amines are derivatives of ammonia in which one or more of the hydrogens is replaced with an alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, or heterocyclic group. When more than one hydrogen has been replaced, the substituents can either be the same or different. Amines are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary depending on the number of hydrogens that have been replaced. Many different types of nitrogen-containing compounds can be reduced to amines. In practice, however, nitriles or nitro compounds are usually used because they are the most easily obtained starting materials. There are several commercial processes for reducing nitro or nitrile groups to amines. Most large volume aromatic and aliphatic amines are made by continuous high pressure catalytic hydrogenation. Nitro compounds can also be reduced in good yields with iron and hydrochloric acid in the Bèchamp process. Aromatic amines are usually made by hydrogenating the corresponding nitro compound, whereas the aliphatic amines generally start with the corresponding nitrile. In the Bèchamp process, nitro compounds are reduced to amines in the presence of iron and an acid. This is the oldest commercial process for preparing amines, and is still used in the dyestuff industry. The method of reducing aromatic nitro compounds with divalent sulfur is known as Zinin reduction. This reaction is carried out in a basic media using sulfides, polysulfides, or hydrosulfides as the reducing agent. Amines, nitro compounds, nitriles, and the various solvents and reagents used in the preparation of amines by reduction vary widely in the hazards they may pose. Some of these materials are acutely toxic by ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin. Others are skin irritants or sensitizers. Still others, by chronic exposure, may cause damage to organs such as the liver or may be carcinogenic. No general rules can govern their safe use in all cases. Regulations governing the safe handling and shipping of amines are given in U.S. Department of Transportation publications. Specific information on safe handling and hazards can be found in the Material Safety Data Sheet for a given material.},

The key features and considerations for each of these deactivation types is reviewed in detail with reference to the latest literature reports in these areas. Two case studies on the deactivation mechanisms of catalysts used for cobalt Fischer-Tropsch and selective catalytic reduction are considered to provide additional depth in the topics of sintering, coking, poisoning, and fouling. Regeneration considerations and options are also briefly discussed for each deactivation mechanism.},

	abstract = {A two-dimensional two-phase (heterogeneous) model that predicts flow maldistributions and hot spots in an adiabatic down-flow packed bed reactor is developed and analyzed. The model considers the effects of fluid flow, changes of physical properties, heat and mass transfer by conduction and convection, interphase gradients and reactant consumption by an exothermic irreversible first-order reaction with Arrhenius kinetics. The one-dimensional model is analyzed in detail using singularity theory. Linear instability theory is used to determine the boundary of the region of parameters at which the uniform down-flow loses stability, and it is shown that flow maldistributions are possible for typical operating conditions. Bifurcation theory, numerical spectral and continuation methods are combined to determine the different types of nonuniform flow patterns and corresponding temperature and concentration fields. Unlike the pseudohomogeneous model where the maximum exit temperature cannot exceed the adiabatic temperature rise (Pem → ∞), the heterogeneous model can have isolated high temperature branches that exist when particle Lewis number is less than unity. It is shown that this maximum temperature on the isolated branch can be as high as β/Le where β is the adiabatic temperature rise {andLe} is the particle Lewis number (Le {\textless} 1.0). Finally, a possible mechanism for the formation of the localized hot spots observed in commercial reactors is proposed; the interphase resistances cause the existence of very high temperature isolated steady-state branches which are attained by the catalyst particles when maldistributed flows occur.},

This article provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art of the {MSR} applied for multiphase reactions. The reactions are classified based on the number of phases involved: fluid−fluid, fluid−solid, and three phase reactions. In the first part of the review, limitations of conventional reactors are discussed in brief. Furthermore, different types of {MSR} and their advantages with respect to their conventional counterparts are described. Particular attention is given to the identification of the parameters that control the flow pattern formed in microcapillaries regarding the mass-transfer efficiency.

The effects of residence time, reaction temperature, and acid concentration, etc., on the reactor performance were studied. The results indicate that in the microreactor the nitration reaction proceeds rapidly, even without sulfuric acid, probably by self-protonation of nitric acid. Also, no by-products were detected. The isomeric distribution of the product nitrotoluenes was found to be identical to that generally found in the mixed-acid nitration. The results were compared with the data obtained from a batch reactor, and the microreactor reaction rates were found to be much higher than the batch reactor rates.},
