	abstract = {Supported cobalt catalysts are preferred for the Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis ({FTS}) in Gas-to-Liquid ({GTL}) plants. Cobalt is a relatively expensive metal, so catalyst lifetime is crucial to the economics of the process. There are clear advantages in using the regeneration of an aged {FTS} catalyst as a catalyst management tool. Oxidative regeneration of spent cobalt catalysts has been the most favored method in both open and patent literature. Aspects of the oxidation and reduction steps of the regeneration process have been investigated from a fundamental point of view, using both model and realistic catalyst systems. This understanding provided insights into the practical application of regeneration where it is shown that multiple regeneration cycles of the aged catalyst can be performed successfully on the demonstration scale.},

Results showed that adsorption behaviors of p-{NT} in the zeolites were different from o-{NT}. The maximum adsorption amounts of p-{NT} in the zeolites were found to be approximately 4 molecules per unit cell (mol./u.c.), irrespective of adsorption temperatures investigated, which were markedly higher than those of o-{NT}. In addition, the presence of acid sites led to an enhanced affinity of p-{NT} adsorption and to suppressed adsorption of o-{NT} in {HZSM}-5 zeolite compared with silicalite-1. Adsorption kinetic results showed that rate constants of p-{NT} were markedly higher than those of o-{NT} in silicalite-1 and {HZSM}-5 zeolite. For the separation of p-{NT}, enhanced selectivity of {HZSM}-5 zeolite for p-{NT} adsorption was observed compared with silicalite-1. Under our optimized conditions, p-{NT} with purity of 98.2 \% could be recovered with {HZSM}-5 zeolite, which was ascribed to the marked differences in adsorption amounts and rate constants between p-{NT} and o-{NT} in the zeolite.},

In this study, partially fluorinated polystyrene (F-{pSt}) and partially fluorinated polymethyl methacrylate (F-{pMMA}) polymers were used to support novel unsymmetrical cobalt({II}) phthalocyanine({CoPc}) via Huisgen’s Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, referred to as the “click chemistry”, and the resulting new structures were elucidated with various well-known spectroscopic techniques. The photocatalytic activity of the novel heterogeneous F-{pStCoPc} and F-{pMMACoPc} catalysts were estimated for the degradation of two well-known dyes, methylene blue ({MB}) and methyl violet ({MV}) in aqueous medium under illumination with visible light (λ {\textgreater} 400 nm) with or without hydrogen peroxide and/or air at specified {pH} values. {UV}–vis spectrophotometry was employed to determine the concentration of the dyes. {MB} and {MV} (10 ppm, 25 {mL}) were completely dissociated (photochemically) with 20 mg of the reported catalyst in 60 min under atmospheric air. The catalyst reported herein is highly recyclable and does not require the presence of well-known semiconductors like {ZnO}/{TiO}2. Besides, the catalyst is stable over a long time and it is recyclable up to five times (without any deactivation). It has been concluded that this procedure will have a bright future for wastewater treatment and green chemistry.},

The effects of residence time, reaction temperature, and acid concentration, etc., on the reactor performance were studied. The results indicate that in the microreactor the nitration reaction proceeds rapidly, even without sulfuric acid, probably by self-protonation of nitric acid. Also, no by-products were detected. The isomeric distribution of the product nitrotoluenes was found to be identical to that generally found in the mixed-acid nitration. The results were compared with the data obtained from a batch reactor, and the microreactor reaction rates were found to be much higher than the batch reactor rates.},

The mediators Co3+ in 3.5 N {HNO}3 and Ce4+ in 60 wt \% H2SO4 are compared with Mn3+ in 60 wt \% H2SO4 for unsubstituted toluene. The mediated oxidation of the toluenes proceeds in three well-distinguished steps: benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid. The last step, which destroys the desired product, the aldehyde, is crucial. Therefore, for continuous resaturation of the electrolyte with toluene and for extraction of benzaldehyde, the benzaldehyde content in the emulgated organic phase has to be kept below a critical value. For toluene,p-chlorotoluene and xylene Mn3+-mediated oxidation only becomes attractive with process temperatures above 60°C. The conversion ofp-nitrotoluene top-nitrobenzaldehyde can only be carried out by Co3+. The reactivities of the oxidants declines in the order: Co3+{\textgreater}Mn3+{\textgreater}Ce4+. Current efficiencies for the recuperation of all oxidants approaches 100\%.},

The methodology covers a wide range of separation problems and consists of selection and identification of separation techniques (and the corresponding separation tasks), the sequencing of the separation tasks and the determination of appropriate and consistent conditions of operation. For a specified multicomponent separation problem, subsets of feasible separation techniques are first identified for every binary and user-specified separation tasks. The number of alternatives for each separation task is reduced by systematically analyzing the relationships between properties, separation technique and conditions of operation. After the final step, an estimate of the final process flowsheet is produced with a list of possible alternatives for the separation tasks. Application of the methodology is demonstrated through examples highlighting the different steps of the methodology.},

A clear difference can be observed between continuous and discontinuous {AVS} configurations; only continuous {AVS} configurations are shifting the flooding boundaries to higher gas and liquid fluxes. The {kLa} of all structured packings with {AVS} is comparable to the {kLa} of a cocurrent packed bed. Flooding in structured packings is qualitatively described by identifying three types of liquid flow. These flows can be manipulated with the configuration of the {AVS} and therefore the flooding point can be influenced.

	abstract = {A two-dimensional two-phase (heterogeneous) model that predicts flow maldistributions and hot spots in an adiabatic down-flow packed bed reactor is developed and analyzed. The model considers the effects of fluid flow, changes of physical properties, heat and mass transfer by conduction and convection, interphase gradients and reactant consumption by an exothermic irreversible first-order reaction with Arrhenius kinetics. The one-dimensional model is analyzed in detail using singularity theory. Linear instability theory is used to determine the boundary of the region of parameters at which the uniform down-flow loses stability, and it is shown that flow maldistributions are possible for typical operating conditions. Bifurcation theory, numerical spectral and continuation methods are combined to determine the different types of nonuniform flow patterns and corresponding temperature and concentration fields. Unlike the pseudohomogeneous model where the maximum exit temperature cannot exceed the adiabatic temperature rise (Pem → ∞), the heterogeneous model can have isolated high temperature branches that exist when particle Lewis number is less than unity. It is shown that this maximum temperature on the isolated branch can be as high as β/Le where β is the adiabatic temperature rise {andLe} is the particle Lewis number (Le {\textless} 1.0). Finally, a possible mechanism for the formation of the localized hot spots observed in commercial reactors is proposed; the interphase resistances cause the existence of very high temperature isolated steady-state branches which are attained by the catalyst particles when maldistributed flows occur.},

Reactant mixture is passed through the reactor at velocities sufficient to fluidize the inerts. Conversions from 0 to 91\% are observed over the temperature range 56° to 261°C and flow rate range 10 to 800 cm3/s.

	abstract = {This chapter explores various technological aspects and conceptual issues relevant to reactor engineering of trickle bed reactors including the industrial applications and engineering science challenges related to design and scale-up. These are gas-liquid-solid contacting devices used in many diverse fields such as the petroleum, petrochemical, fine chemical, and biochemical industries. The trickle bed reactors contribute significantly to manufacturing cleaner fuels by hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrogenation reactions in refineries. Several other types of reactions involving hydrogenation, oxidation, alkylation, and chlorination are carried out advantageously in trickle bed reactors. Some examples of the industrial applications of trickle bed reactors are: ethanol oxidation, wet oxidation of phenol, hydrogenation of various petroleum fractions, nitrocompounds, carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acids to alcohols (adipic acid to 1,6-hexanediol), catalytic dewaxing, dearomatization, and others. Current and future emphasis on cleaner fuels and increasing new applications of trickle bed reactors demand in-depth understanding of the engineering tools to enable manipulation and control of the trickle bed reactors for improved performance. In recent years, several variants of trickle bed reactors, including micro reactors and mesh reactors, have been introduced, while the attempts to further develop the design and scale-up methodologies continue. The performance of trickle bed reactors depends on several issues such as characteristics of the catalytic bed (packing configuration, porosity, particle size/coating thickness), flow maldistribution, wetting of catalyst particles and local interphase heat and mass transfer rates, intraparticle mass and heat transfer, and reaction kinetics. The configuration and characteristics of the catalytic bed influence the underlying fluid dynamics and therefore the local transport rates, wetting, and mixing of the fluid phases in trickle bed reactors.},

	abstract = {The liquid phase oxidation of toluene to benzoic acid by pure oxygen has been performed in a bubble reactor by using cobalt acetate tetrahydrate as catalyst. The influence of the oxygen partial pressures on the reaction kinetics were first investigated, and the results showed that the influence was neglectable in the high oxygen pressure range ({\textgreater}0.5 {MPa}) under 155°C. Thereby, the reaction rates in the oxidation using pure oxygen are independent of the oxygen partial pressure and expressed as the first order to liquid reactants. Based on a kinetic scheme that involves both benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde, the kinetic models can well describe the reaction process. Furthermore, the results indicated that the production of benzyl alcohol is much slower than its consumption to form benzaldehyde and the scheme can be further simplified to a kinetic equation, which involves only benzaldehyde as intermediate. The simplified reaction scheme also well describes the reaction, and, thus, the derived kinetic models agree well with the experimental data. The reaction constants follow the Arrhenius law. The estimated activation energies are in the range from 92.63 {kJ}·mol−1 to 67.81 {kJ}·mol−1.},

	abstract = {Amines are derivatives of ammonia in which one or more of the hydrogens is replaced with an alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, or heterocyclic group. When more than one hydrogen has been replaced, the substituents can either be the same or different. Amines are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary depending on the number of hydrogens that have been replaced. Many different types of nitrogen-containing compounds can be reduced to amines. In practice, however, nitriles or nitro compounds are usually used because they are the most easily obtained starting materials. There are several commercial processes for reducing nitro or nitrile groups to amines. Most large volume aromatic and aliphatic amines are made by continuous high pressure catalytic hydrogenation. Nitro compounds can also be reduced in good yields with iron and hydrochloric acid in the Bèchamp process. Aromatic amines are usually made by hydrogenating the corresponding nitro compound, whereas the aliphatic amines generally start with the corresponding nitrile. In the Bèchamp process, nitro compounds are reduced to amines in the presence of iron and an acid. This is the oldest commercial process for preparing amines, and is still used in the dyestuff industry. The method of reducing aromatic nitro compounds with divalent sulfur is known as Zinin reduction. This reaction is carried out in a basic media using sulfides, polysulfides, or hydrosulfides as the reducing agent. Amines, nitro compounds, nitriles, and the various solvents and reagents used in the preparation of amines by reduction vary widely in the hazards they may pose. Some of these materials are acutely toxic by ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin. Others are skin irritants or sensitizers. Still others, by chronic exposure, may cause damage to organs such as the liver or may be carcinogenic. No general rules can govern their safe use in all cases. Regulations governing the safe handling and shipping of amines are given in U.S. Department of Transportation publications. Specific information on safe handling and hazards can be found in the Material Safety Data Sheet for a given material.},

This review on deactivation and regeneration of heterogeneous catalysts classifies deactivation by type (chemical, thermal, and mechanical) and by mechanism (poisoning, fouling, thermal degradation, vapor formation, vapor-solid and solid-solid reactions, and attrition/crushing). The key features and considerations for each of these deactivation types is reviewed in detail with reference to the latest literature reports in these areas. Two case studies on the deactivation mechanisms of catalysts used for cobalt Fischer-Tropsch and selective catalytic reduction are considered to provide additional depth in the topics of sintering, coking, poisoning, and fouling. Regeneration considerations and options are also briefly discussed for each deactivation mechanism.},

This article provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art of the {MSR} applied for multiphase reactions. The reactions are classified based on the number of phases involved: fluid−fluid, fluid−solid, and three phase reactions. In the first part of the review, limitations of conventional reactors are discussed in brief. Furthermore, different types of {MSR} and their advantages with respect to their conventional counterparts are described. Particular attention is given to the identification of the parameters that control the flow pattern formed in microcapillaries regarding the mass-transfer efficiency. Case studies of various multiphase reactions carried out in {MSR} are discussed in detail.},

To react quickly and with low costs to these demanding reactions, additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is a preferred way for the production of customized reactors. This work presents three examples of 3D printed reactors and their application for the synthesis of {API} precursors in continuous flow. The first case deals with an aerobic oxidation of Grignard reagents to the corresponding phenols by molecular oxygen. Here, a design concept was utilized; various stainless steel reactors were tested, and their performances were evaluated in continuous flow. Next, another stainless steel reactor was applied for achieving fast mixing in a cascade, leading to a valsartan precursor. The third and final case employed a continuous stirred tank reactor ({CSTR}) made of a {UV}-curable resin. It was used for the first step of a multiphase enzymatic decarboxylation followed by a Heck cross-coupling reaction, leading to resveratrol derivatives.},

The recovered solvent purities were {\textgreater}99.9 wt \% for the first solvent (Solvent 1) and {\textgreater}99.8 wt \% for the second solvent (Solvent 2), and the recovery yields were 94.9\% and 98.3\%, respectively. From the E-factor analysis, approximately 30\% less waste was generated in the {ICM} process compared with a corresponding batch process. After integration of the solvent recovery system, the E-factors for both the batch and {ICM} processes decreased significantly, from 1.63 to 0.29 and from 0.77 to 0.21, respectively.},
