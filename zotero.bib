	abstract = {Nitrobenzene is a pale yellow to yellowish brown liquid with a boiling point of 207–212°C, depending on its purity. It is a very toxic substance with a maximum allowable concentration ({PEL}) of 1 ppm. The commercial production of nitrobenzene involves the direct nitration of benzene using a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids, with typical yields of 96–99\%. The main derivatives of nitrobenzene are ortho-, meta-, and para-nitrochlorobenzene. These are toxic, with a {PEL} of 0.1 ppm for p-nitrochlorobenzene. Nitrotoluene exists as three isomers: o-, m-, and p-nitrotoluene. The o- and m-nitrotoluenes are clear yellow liquids at 25°C, whereas p-nitrotoluene is a crystalline solid (mp 53.5°C). The nitrotoluenes are fairly toxic, with a {PEL} of 2 ppm.},

	abstract = {Solvents make a large contribution to the environmental impact of manufacturing processes of active pharmaceutical ingredients ({API}), as well as playing an important role in other chemical industries, with millions of tons used and disposed of each year. {GlaxoSmithKline} ({GSK}) has previously reported on the both the development of a {GSK} solvent selection guide and the incorporation of solvent life cycle inventory and assessment information. The {GSK} solvent selection guide has been further enhanced by: • Revising the assessments of factors that impact process safety, separating reactivity from fire and explosion rankings. • More than doubling the number of solvents in the guide, to a total of 110 from the initial 47. • Adding a customised solvent selection guide appropriate for medicinal chemistry and analytical laboratories. The new {GSK} solvent selection guide enables {GSK} scientists to objectively assess solvents and determine whether existing or new solvents brought to market as ‘greener’ alternatives truly represent a more sustainable choice or whether they are just addressing a single issue associated with sustainability.},

How they can be used most effectively to enhance the greenness of chemical processes, particularly in laboratory organic synthesis and the pharmaceutical industry, is addressed in detail.Graphical {abstractThis} review assesses the advances made in green solvent selection using tabular guides and related tools.},
